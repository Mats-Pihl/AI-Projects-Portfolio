## Problem
Detect whether an SMS message is spam or legitimate (ham) using natural language processing techniques.

## Approach
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using:
  - Bag of Words (Binary)
  - Term Frequency (TF)
  - TF-IDF
  - Word2Vec embeddings
- Logistic Regression classifier for prediction

## Results
The model successfully distinguishes spam from legitimate messages with high accuracy using multiple NLP feature representations.

## Skills Demonstrated
NLP preprocessing, feature engineering, vectorization techniques, model training, and evaluation.
